# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-for-phrases-reviews-
Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset, create our own Neural Network model to get the best result

<b> Preprocessing </b>
* removing html tags from each token
* Tokenization
* Translation table
* Process of translating
* removing non alpha words  
* filter out stop words
* Lemmatization process
* Removing words with length

<b> Creation of Vocal </b>
This ipynb file is to create a bag of words after preprocessing the dataset.
This is done for both positive and negative 

<b> NLP Sentiment Anaylysis for Phrase Reviews </b>
* A new sequential Nerual Networks is created to get the best result
* Has 3 LSTM Layers, Sigmoid as activation layer & Adam Optimizer.
* At last we compare our model with other exisiting Machine learning Algorithms like: Logistic Regression, Bernoulli model, Gradient Boost Classifier model, Bagged Decision Tree Classifier model & Support Vector Machine model.
